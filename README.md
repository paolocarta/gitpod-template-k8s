## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with k3s on Gitpod, copy the `.gitpod.yml` and the `.gitpod` folder to your own project. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.


### Connecting via kubectl

When you open your workspace terminal, the `kubectl` is already configured for you
via the `~/.kube/config` file.
